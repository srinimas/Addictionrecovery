# AddictionRecovery

## About the project

AddictionRecovery is an app built to make alcohol addicts realize the danger they are in and making themselves taking a step to their cure. The user needs to create an account in the site and then answer a set of 5 to 6 questions by which the app will be able to tell the level of risk they have. Based on the level of risk the app offers them the destination level they want them to see themselves in a given time. the user has the freedom of choosing both the destination and deadline. Standing true to its name the app doesnt collect personal information of user like his name, addrees, etc. The user will be recognized by a secret id after he logs in. The user after logging in can see his activity dashboard in the form of a radar chart along with the activites he has to do and the current pace he is at. The higher the deadline the more are the number of activities given. Once each activity has been completed the suer can mark them as completed. This gamification would enhance the user's intrest in removing his addiction thus making him stronger in the battle of fighting his addictions.
